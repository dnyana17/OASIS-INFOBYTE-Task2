            Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India. His father, Motilal Nehru (1861–1931),
             a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community, served twice as president of the Indian
              National Congress, in 1919 and 1928. His mother, Swarup Rani Thussu (1868–1938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri 
              Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife, his first having died in childbirth. Jawaharlal was 
              the eldest of three children. His elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first female president of the United 
              Nations General Assembly. His youngest sister, Krishna Hutheesing, became a noted writer and authored several books on 
              her brother.

            Before Nehru was decorated with the Bharat Ratna in July 1955, it had been awarded only on two occasions.
             On Independence Day in 1954. Jawaharlal Nehru 14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an Indian anti-colonial 
             nationalist, secular humanist, social democrat and author who was a central figure in India during the middle
             of the 20th century. 
            Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s.
             Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's prime minister for 16 years.
             Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s,
             powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of 
             the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as Letters from a
             Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read 
             around the world. During his lifetime, the honorific Pandit was commonly applied before his name in India.
